A price update is\n necessary if the current on-chain publishTime is older than the given publishTime.

If all of price feeds within `priceIds` have updated and have\n a newer or equal publish time than the given publish time, it will reject the transaction to save gas.\n Otherwise, it calls updatePriceFeeds method to update the prices.\n @dev Reverts if update is not needed or the transferred fee is not sufficient or the updateData is invalid.\n @param updateData Array of price update data.\n @param priceIds Array of price ids.\n @param publishTimes Array of publishTimes. `publishTimes[i]` corresponds to known `publishTime` of `priceIds[i]`"
